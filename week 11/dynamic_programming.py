### Nemoization and Tabulation, are the core of DP
## Recursion forms the basis of these 2 techniques



# Obtain the 5th number in the Fibo sequence
#Tracing tree
### Two types of complexity: Time and Space
## Space complexity uses memory storage a LOT
## as number of elements in a recursion go up the number of times the function is called exponentially increases
## Different types of time complexity: ex. the quicksort function we did in recursions
# time complexities we want to achieve are linear or less
